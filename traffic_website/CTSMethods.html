                    <h3>Research Questions, Methodology, and Findings</h3>
                    <p>
                        In our study of Chicago traffic patterns, we originally set out to discover whether 
                        traffic cameras had an affect on the number of accidents within a city. We selected 
                        Chicago as the city we would examine based on the publicly available information it 
                        provided in its APIs. In an ideal world, we would be able to compare the number of 
                        accidents prior to traffic camera implementation with the number of accidents afterwards 
                        to determine if there was a correlation between the amount of traffic cameras and the number of accidents 
                        in a given area. Unfortunately, this information was not available to us. 
                        As a result, we focused on discovering a correlation between the number of traffic 
                        cameras and the amount of accidents from 2016 to March 2019. </p>

                    <p>
                        To compare traffic cameras with accidents, we 
                        used a series of <a href = "CTSVisualB.html">regions</a> provided by the city of Chicago. Our datasets provided 
                        latitude and longitude for each region, each accident, and each camera, and we assigned a numerical
                        region to each crash and each camera. We could then determine that there was a positive correlation
                        between traffic cameras and accidents.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We had some concerns that this correlation was due to a kind of reverse causality; there were more cameras in areas 
                        where traffic accidents were more common, rather than the other way around. In order to assess this, we tried various 
                        methods of normalizing our data to account for differences in regional traffic flows. One of these methods involved 
                        not assessing the number of accidents, but the <a href= "CTSVisualE.html">rate</a> of <a href = "CTSVisualD.html">injuries and fatalities</a> 
                        those accidents produced. Using this method, we were able to determine that the presence of traffic cameras had no correlation
                        with injury and fatality rate per accident.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The datasets we used contained a wealth of information not related to our original research question.
                        I've included some of the more interesting visualizations here as well. One of them shows the <a href = "CTSVisualC.html">regional
                        prevalence of accidents caused by drunk driving.</a>
